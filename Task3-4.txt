What is the difference between the 3 types of regression:
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

The difference between Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression is that we have multiple X columns instead of 1.
Polynomial is curved instead of linear. We couldn't run the code as the right datafile wasn't available so it was hard to identify the exact differences.

in which type of projects each of them fits best?
If your dataset only has 2 columns you can use Linear regression just fine by choosing one as X and another as y.
If your dataset has more than 2 features you would probably use Multiple Linear Regression.
If you have alot of samples and multiple features and the data values follow a more eksponential rise or decrease instead of linear we would use Polynomial Regression.
